there's also custom tags:
[spd 0.5] - change text speed to 0.5 symbols/frame
[inst 5] - instantly display next 5 symbols
[snd sans] - choose sans soundbit
[wait 60] - delay for 60 frames
[event custom_event_data] - emits custom event with ""custom_event_data"". Never use this tag pls, it's only for programmers."
TRANSLATION_EXAMPLE,"[color=gray][inst 13]!!!warning!!![/color]

THRONE_ASGORE_DIALOGUE4,"[noskip]*Unfortunately, you will have to face one more tonight."
THRONE_ASGORE_DIALOGUE5,[noskip]*I've been waiting for you.

REFUSE_DIAL5_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* You still refused to fight.

REFUSE_DIAL5_5,Did you encounter someone named Undyne on your journey?
REFUSE_DIAL6_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* You still refused to fight.
REFUSE_DIAL6_2,[center]* [color=red]ASGORE[/color] continues to elaborate.
REFUSE_DIAL6_3,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]I raised and cared for her as if she were a blood relative.
REFUSE_DIAL6_4,"But as she grew older, I knew I would eventually have to tell her the truth."
REFUSE_DIAL7_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* You still refused to fight.
REFUSE_DIAL7_2,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* ...

REFUSE_DIAL9_3,"But thanks to you, now they can be."
REFUSE_DIAL9_4,Would you like to know why?
REFUSE_DIAL10_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* ...
REFUSE_DIAL10_2,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]The numerous determination experiments that my royal scientist conducted…
REFUSE_DIAL10_3,Made me appreciate how powerful a human [color=red]SOUL[/color] really was.
REFUSE_DIAL11_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* ...
REFUSE_DIAL11_2,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]Through the power of the determination...
REFUSE_DIAL11_3,I will give us all a second chance.
REFUSE_DIAL12_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* Dad...

REFUSE_DIAL12_3,Everyone will be satisfied.
REFUSE_DIAL13_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* ...
REFUSE_DIAL13_2,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]I was the one that ordered the experiments that destroyed countless families.
REFUSE_DIAL13_3,I made the royal scientist loathe herself.
REFUSE_DIAL14_1,"[event box_dial][snd default][center]* Please don't do this, dad..."
REFUSE_DIAL14_2,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]Think about it...
REFUSE_DIAL14_3,All of it can be swept away like a bad dream.
REFUSE_DIAL15_1,[event box_dial][snd default][center]* ...
REFUSE_DIAL15_2,[snd asgore][event enemy_dial]One final act of cruelty to save possibly millions.

BAD_ENDING_DIAL3,...
BAD_ENDING_DIAL4,And to think I had it in me to destroy humanity...
BAD_ENDING_DIAL5,"I really have become pathetic, haven't I...?"
BAD_ENDING_DIAL6,And weak... and so tired.
BAD_ENDING_DIAL7,"Young one, the fighting is over..."
BAD_ENDING_DIAL8,So please...
BAD_ENDING_DIAL9,Just take my soul...

BAD_ENDING_EPILOGUE14,"[color=gray]* Come on, before your tea gets cold."
BAD_ENDING_EPILOGUE15,[snd asgore][event turn_on_faces][event face_asgore5]* ...
BAD_ENDING_EPILOGUE16,[event face_asgore6]* I missed you all so much…
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL1,[event enemy_dial][snd asgore]Is this some sort of joke?
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL2,Do you seriously still expect something to happen...
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL3,Just because I spilled my guts out to you?
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL4,I've already told you...
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL5,You aren't leaving here alive.
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL6,[event his_reluctance]Quit this foolish act...
FIGHT_PHASE1_END_DIAL7,Stop making things more difficult.
FIGHT_PHASE3_TRANSITION1,"[snd asgore]My children must live, even if it kills me!"
FIGHT_PHASE3_TRANSITION2,"If you won’t fight, then stand still and die like you’re supposed to!!"
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL1,[snd asgore]...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL2,To think I had it in me to destroy your kind...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL3,I can’t even bring myself to kill you.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL4,"This was your plan, wasn't it?"
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL5,To exhaust me?
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL6,To have me on my knees?
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL7,"Well, now’s your chance."

PHASE3_ENDING_MERCY6,Please stop.
PHASE3_ENDING_MERCY7,I don’t understand.
PHASE3_ENDING_MERCY8,I can't understand.
PHASE3_ENDING_MERCY9,I…
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE1,…
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE2,I remember the day I lost my son...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE3,My wife and I were already in mourning from another child lost...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE4,"A human, like yourself, who fell from the surface."
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE5,My son was determined not to let his sibling’s death be in vain.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE6,He left for the surface with their soul.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE7,"But, within a few hours he returned."
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE8,He was so badly wounded...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE9,He couldn’t speak a single word.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE10,It wasn’t long before he was gone.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE11,"In my grief, I lashed out..."
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE12,[event flowey_appears]Everything is like this because of me...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE13,[event flowey_talks][snd flowey]Enough!
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE14,"I could forgive the nihilism, the neglect of your people, the SOUL snatching..."
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE15,But you've allowed your pain to define your entire legacy.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE16,If you truely cared about saving the underground...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE17,You would be the leader it needs.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE18,[event flowey_sad]You’ve allowed yourself to go on like this for ages...
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE19,[snd asgore][event asgore_talks]I know…
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE20,[snd flowey][event flowey_talks]But you can still be that leader right now.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE21,"It’s never too late, Asgore."
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE22,Let us help you.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE23,[snd asgore][event asgore_talks]You’re right…
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_CONTINUE24,About everything.
SLIDES_DIAL1_1,[snd asgore]I could have brought their hopes up.
SLIDES_DIAL1_2,"But, Instead I blamed everyone."
SLIDES_DIAL2_1,"[snd asgore]My guards, my wife, my whole kingdom."
SLIDES_DIAL2_2,But not myself.
SLIDES_DIAL2_3,Never myself.
SLIDES_DIAL2_4,Until it was too late.
SLIDES_DIAL3_1,[snd asgore]My wife became disgusted with me.
SLIDES_DIAL3_2,She left and I never saw her again.
SLIDES_DIAL4_1,[snd asgore]I hurt so people through my desperation to get away from everything.
SLIDES_DIAL4_2,And justified all of it with nonsense.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_END1,[snd asgore]I’m so sorry.
PHASE3_ENDING_DIAL_END2,I just miss them so much...
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL1,"[snd asgore][event asgore_emotion1]Thank you, both of you."
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL2,I promise that I will take full responsibility for my wrong doings.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL3,I will do everything in my power to make things right.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL4,So many have been hurt in my wake.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL5,I don't expect forgiveness from everyone.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL6,[snd flowey][event flowey_emotion1]Don't sell yourself short!
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL7,"It might take a while, but in time..."
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL8,I’m sure everyone will come around.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL9,"[snd asgore][event asgore_emotion1]Young one, you may have to stay here for a while..."
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL10,At least until a new solution for the barrier is found.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL11,I promise I will take good care of you.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL12,"We can sit in the living room, telling stories, eating butterscotch pie."
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL13,We could be like a family.
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL14,...
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL15,Let’s leave this place...
ENDING_OVERWORLD_DIAL16,Together.
