there's also custom tags:
[spd 0.5] - change text speed to 0.5 symbols/frame
[inst 5] - instantly display next 5 symbols
[snd sans] - choose sans soundbit
[wait 60] - delay for 60 frames
[event custom_event_data] - emits custom event with ""custom_event_data"". Never use this tag pls, it's only for programmers."
