TRANSLATION_GUIDE,"Our dialogue system supports BBCODE tags
here's a guide about tags: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/ui/bbcode_in_richtextlabel.html?highlight=bbcode#reference

there's also custom tags:
[spd 0.5] - change text speed to 0.5 symbols/frame
[inst 5] - instantly display next 5 symbols
[snd sans] - choose sans soundbit
[wait 60] - delay for 60 frames
[event custom_event_data] - emits custom event with ""custom_event_data"". Never use this tag pls, it's only for programmers."
TRANSLATION_EXAMPLE,"[color=gray][inst 13]!!!warning!!![/color]
[spd 0.9][snd sans]fast text with... [wait 60]sans soundbit
[spd 0.1][snd null]slow text without sound bite."
